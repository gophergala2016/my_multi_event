My Multi Event
--------------

Written for Gopher Gala 2016 by Andrew Sellers

So, sometimes you want people to register for an event and fill in some information
on it. Like Name, Email, Shirt Size, Allergies, whatever. I thought it would be cool
to build a very simple website for that. You can register an event, add some 
instructions and questions to it. There's a bunch of features that didn't quite make
it, so it's really basic at the moment.

I've built better things with less time, but I got to play around with several new
things, so I'm calling this a good experience.

* Angular app from scratch (not that fancy though)
* Content Security Policy (no inline Javascript, or XSS)
* Go 1.6 block templates
* JSON files as a datastore
